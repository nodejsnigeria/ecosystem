# Node.js Nigeria
Node.js Nigeria is a group of Node.js developers in Nigeria that feel they belong together, care for one another and consider important their interaction with all the components that constitute their experiences as members of the ecosystem.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to build an ecosystem of Software Engineers in Nigeria who use Node.js, are globally competent (and competitive), and actively contribute to the development of the Open Source ecosystem at large. Everything the we do must always take us a step closer to accomplishing this mission.

To achieve our goal, weâ€™ll be engaged in the following from time to time:

- Meetings: conferences, meetups, hackathons, e.t.c
- Content creation: blog posts, tutorials, webinars, screencasts, podcasts e.t.c
- Mentorship
- Job search and talent recruitment aid
- Helping with applications for CFPs for meetups and conferences within and outside Nigeria
- Other things we discover would be necessary to keep our ecosystem healthy and growing
